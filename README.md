# ethereum-social-identity

A spec and (eventually, maybe by the time I edit this readme next), an implementation of public social identity for an ethereum address.

### Why?
Web3, and more general, address based authentication (read: message signing) leaves some to be desired. 
Projects like [uPort](https://developer.uport.me/) are building SSO (Single Sign On) for Ethereum. While this effort is to be applauded, I envision a simpler system.

### Why would I want to associate my identity with an Ethereum address? Isn't Blockchain supposed to be private?
While some users of various chains may want complete privacy around their transactions, other users desire the exact opposite. 
For example, at [Grant.io](http://grant.io), we're building a platform for decentralized [crowd]funding.
Users on our platform may desire to be very public indeed, especially so that they can show the various projects they have granted money to.
In other cases, proposers on our platform will be required to provide _some_ additional identifying information, so that potential donors can properly vet them. 
Think associatiating an ethereum address with a (potentially anonymous) GitHub profile.

### Ok, so what's a typical flow?
TBD
